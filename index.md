### Customer churn analysis

Customer churn is the number of existing customers lost over a given period of time. It provides companies with an understanding of customer satisfaction and customer loyalty, and can identify potential changes in a companyâ€™s bottom line. In this project, I explored the drivers of increased customer churn rates and create a customer churn tracking dashboard.

### Marketing mix modeling

Marketing mix modeling is a a method for statistically estimating the business contribution of media and marketing activities, enableing the diagnosis, prediction and prescription of media and marketing activities based on business contribution. It's a interesting concept I learn from a webinar by Decision Lab.

This page is currently blank. I put it here as a note to remind myself to gather necessary knowledge and build a project about it later.
