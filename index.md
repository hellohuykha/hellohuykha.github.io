### Customer churn analysis

Customer churn is the number of existing customers lost, for any reason at all, over a given period of time. It provides companies with an understanding of customer satisfaction and customer loyalty, and can identify potential changes in a companyâ€™s bottom line. In this project, I explored the drivers of increased customer churn rates and conduct A/B testing of a potential intervention to at-risk customers.
