### Customer churn analysis

Customer churn is the number of existing customers lost over a given period of time. It provides companies with an understanding of customer satisfaction and customer loyalty, and can identify potential changes in a companyâ€™s bottom line. In this project, I explored the drivers of increased customer churn rates and create a customer churn tracking dashboard.

### Heading for the Future 2023: Ecommerce sales analysis

Heading for the Future (H4TF) is an innovative hackathon designed to empower young minds to tackle challenges in various fields, including data analytics. In this challenge, participants were tasked with analyzing sales data of a e-commerce business spanning across 4 years to evaluate the company' financial performance as well as customers' preference.

I took part in this challenge, using SQL to calculate total revenue by product, by country, and total number of repeated customers, etc, and later created a financial performance tracking dashboard.
